# Ender-Compass
Minecraft mod for Java Edition 1.20.x that implements the ender compass, an item that points to the nearest stronghold. This mod is intended to make it easier to use eyes of ender to go to the end, as throwing eyes of ender can be time-consuming and inconvenient (i.e. the eyes can get lost in trees or randomly disappear).

An ender compass is crafted in a crafting table using four eyes of ender and one compass, as follows:

In the nether or end, the ender compass spins randomly, as there are no strongholds in these dimensions. The same is true in the overworld if stronghold generation is disabled. For more information, see the project page at [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/ender-compass).
